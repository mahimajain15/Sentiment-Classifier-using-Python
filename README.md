# Sentiment-Classifier-using-Python

In this post I'll share the code and how I've implemented Sentiment Classifier using Python. For this purpose data set used is tensorflow dataset of IMDB reviews. IMDB reviews given by viewers about various movies (tensorflow_dataset). The dataset is consists of reviews in English language.


Algorithm in short : 


preprocess the data
convert English data to numerical representations
prepare it to be fed as input for our deeplearning model with GRUs.
